# Logic Lab 1G

A board that provides 12 logic gates that you can interconnect with patch cables to make a variety of different logic circuits. This version is implemented with 12 individual logic gates.

For more information see <http://www.technoblogy.com/show?4ODG>.

Alternatively see [Logic Lab](https://github.com/technoblogy/logic-lab) which is functionally identical, but implemented using an AVR microcontroller.
